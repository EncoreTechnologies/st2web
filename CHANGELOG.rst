  Contributed by @amanda11

* Prepared the source for the Node 24 / Rsbuild toolchain (no behaviour change):

  - Removed Flow type annotations (``flow-remove-types``); the type-only
    ``modules/st2flow-model/interfaces.js`` is deleted.
  - Replaced legacy ``@connect`` class decorators with plain
    ``connect(...)(Component)`` calls (40 classes in 32 files).
  - Renamed CSS-module stylesheets (previously selected per package via
    browserify ``modularize`` and the ``.pcss`` extension) to ``*.module.css``.

* Moved the build to Node.js 24 LTS and replaced the toolchain:

  - gulp + browserify + babel + lerna/yarn replaced by Rsbuild 2 (``rsbuild.config.mjs``)
    and npm workspaces (``package-lock.json``). ``build/`` keeps its layout (``css/``,
    ``js/``, ``img/``, ``font/``, unbundled ``config.js``, ``package.meta(.js)``).
  - mocha replaced by Rstest with jsdom (``rstest.config.mjs``); tests import
    ``describe``/``it``/hooks from ``@rstest/core``. Bootstrap shims in
    ``@stackstorm/module-test-utils`` only fill in what jsdom lacks. Fixed tests that relied on
    globals or API state leaked from other test files (pack-icon made a real network request).
  - ESLint 6 + babel-eslint replaced by ESLint 9 flat config (``eslint.config.mjs``) with
    ``@stylistic`` for formatting rules. ESLint 10 is held back until ``eslint-plugin-react``
    supports it.
  - Every workspace now declares exactly the packages its source imports (internal packages
    as ``*``), and is ``private``. Removed transitive security pins that only existed for
    the old toolchain.
  - Node built-ins are no longer polyfilled: ``url``/``querystring`` replaced with
    ``URL``/``URLSearchParams``; ``react-time`` replaced by a ``moment``-based ``<time>``.
  - Removed ``tasks/``, ``gulpfile.js``, ``lerna.json``, ``bower.json``, ``Vagrantfile``,
    ``bootstrap.sh`` and the Flow/csscomb configs. Dockerfiles use ``node:24-alpine``.

* Upgraded to React 19 (19.3.1), react-redux 9, redux 5 and react-router 8:

  - ``createRoot`` replaces ``ReactDOM.render``; the automatic JSX runtime and fast refresh are on,
    so files no longer import ``React`` just for JSX.
  - ``propTypes`` and the ``prop-types`` package are removed (React 19 ignores them).
  - The panel's legacy ``scrollIntoView`` context is now ``ScrollIntoViewContext``
    (``React.createContext``), used by the action, pack, rule and trigger cards.
  - ``UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps`` replaced: ``getDerivedStateFromProps`` for the clone
    dialog's pack list, ``componentDidUpdate`` for auto-form text fields.
  - ``modules/st2-router`` keeps its Redux-driven design; a small hash history replaces the
    ``history`` package and route matching uses react-router 8's ``matchPath``.
  - The store uses redux's ``legacy_createStore``.
  - ``react-hotkeys`` 1.x (needs ``findDOMNode``, removed in React 19) replaced by
    ``react-hotkeys-hook`` for the workflow designer shortcuts; keys typed into inputs are still
    ignored. The per-task ``HotKeys`` wrapper is gone: its only handler had no key bound to it.
  - ``react-textarea-autosize`` 8 is used directly (no subclass).
  - Existing tests keep ``react-test-renderer`` 19 (deprecated; its warning is muted) with renders
    and handler calls wrapped in ``act()``. New tests use ``@testing-library/react``. Added tests
    for the router's hash history and route matching and for workflow transition clicks.
  - Coverage now includes untested JSX files, so it reports about 28% of lines, not 45%.

* Upgraded third-party dependencies with supply-chain guardrails:

  - New ``.npmrc``: ``min-release-age=14`` (npm only resolves versions published at least 14 days
    ago), ``ignore-scripts=true`` and ``allow-git=none``. The Dockerfiles copy it before ``npm ci``.
    All versions are pinned exactly and the lockfile was regenerated under these rules; every
    package has a verified registry signature, none has an install script, and none is a version
    from the 2026 axios or Shai-Hulud/ChainDrop (keyv, flat-cache, file-entry-cache) compromises.
  - Packages pinned in earlier steps that were still inside the cooldown were moved back to the
    newest release outside it (Rsbuild 2.2.13, Rstest 0.12.3, react-redux 9.3.0, react-router 8.4.0,
    postcss 8.5.30, postcss-nested 9.0.0, postcss-preset-env 11.6.1).
  - ``follow-redirects`` 1.16.2 and ``fast-uri`` 3.1.9 are security fixes newer than the cooldown;
    both were reviewed by hand and pinned through ``overrides`` with a dated exception in ``.npmrc``.
  - axios 0.24 → 1.20 (``st2-api``): list filters are joined before axios serializes the query
    instead of deep-importing ``axios/lib/helpers/buildURL``, and the request id is read from
    ``x-request-id``.
  - moxios (unmaintained) → axios-mock-adapter in tests.
  - noty (deprecated) and escape-html → a small built-in toast in ``st2-notification`` with the same
    look and behaviour. Text is set as text rather than escaped HTML; the timer pauses on hover.
  - brace (Ace 1.2.9, abandoned) → ace-builds 1.45 in the workflow editor.
  - ajv 6 → 8 in ``st2flow-model`` (non-strict, no regex ``u`` flag, to accept the generated
    orquesta/mistral schemas); error marks use Ajv 8's ``instancePath``. Messages now read "must"
    instead of "should".
  - deep-diff (deprecated) → ``lodash.isEqual``; the model's ``change`` event now passes only the
    YAML, since no listener used the deltas.
  - chai-subset dropped: chai 6 has ``containSubset`` built in.
  - lodash 4.18.1, moment 2.31.0, eventemitter3 5, validator 13.15.35, prismjs 1.30.0,
    classnames 2.5.1, debug 4.4.3.
  - Added tests for the notifier, schema-error formatting and API query serialization.
  - Production dependencies have no ``npm audit`` findings. The remaining dev-only finding is
    minimatch (ReDoS) inside ESLint 9, fixed only in minimatch 11, which no ESLint release uses yet.

* Moved the tests to Testing Library and Playwright, replaced the YAML parser and linted with
  ESLint 10:

  - ``react-test-renderer`` (deprecated) is gone: every component test renders into the DOM with
    ``@testing-library/react`` (``renderNode()`` in ``@stackstorm/module-test-utils``) and drives
    real events. Added unit tests for every package that had none (all eight apps, st2-store,
    st2-forms, st2-flow-link, st2-notification, st2flow-details/editor/palette/notifications/perf);
    791 tests, about 81% of lines covered (was 28%).
  - The zombie functional tests are replaced by Playwright specs in ``tests/`` (``npm run
    test-functional``): login, actions, history, rules, packs, triggers, inquiries and the workflow
    designer, against a running st2web and StackStorm. They only change what they create.
  - ``yaml-ast-parser`` (unmaintained since 2018) is replaced by ``yaml`` 2.9 behind an adapter
    (``modules/st2flow-yaml/parser.js``) that produces the same node tree, positions and scalar
    types. Checked against 8,854 real workflow and action files: the designer's YAML output is
    identical for all of them; data differs only where the old parser was wrong (``''`` before a
    line break, a leading blank line in ``|`` blocks, ``+`` chomping), now matching PyYAML.
    A multi-line quoted scalar whose closing line is indented no deeper than its key (invalid
    YAML that PyYAML accepts, e.g. st2's ``examples.orquesta-test-jinja-data-functions``) is now
    reported as a YAML error in the designer.
  - ESLint 10 with ``@eslint-react/eslint-plugin`` in place of ``eslint-plugin-react`` and
    ``eslint-plugin-react-hooks`` (neither supports ESLint 10), and a local license-header rule in
    place of ``eslint-plugin-notice``. Fixed what the new rules found: ``setState`` reading
    ``this.state``, a key placed after a spread, ``<Context.Provider>``, unused class members.
  - Removed the unused ``st2flow-header`` package.

Fixed
~~~~~
* Fixed the UI failing to load ("process is not defined") without browserify's ``process``
  polyfill: ``st2-api`` now only sets ``NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`` under Node, and
  ``st2flow-perf``'s Node check no longer reads ``process`` when it is undefined.
* Removed a workflow-transition click listener that never ran (it registered
  ``() => this.props.onClick``); clicks were already handled through React's ``onClick``.
* Moved the task badge ``composes`` in ``st2flow-canvas`` to top-level classes, which CSS modules
  require when nesting isn't flattened first.
* The workflow designer could not place a YAML error on the first line of the file in the editor.
* Workflow metadata errors in the designer were listed without keys (React warning, and the list
  could mix up entries when it changed).
* The workflow designer's zoom buttons were drawn over Undo/Redo/Rearrange/Save, and Save no longer
  glowed on unsaved changes (so Run looked disabled for no visible reason). The toolbar appended
  ``-right``/``-glow`` to a CSS-module class name, which only worked with browserify's naming; it now
  looks the modifier class up. Playwright checks that no toolbar button is covered and that Save glows.
* The workflow designer reported ``tasks.<task>.with - must be object`` for orquesta's
  ``with: <expression>`` shorthand. The model now expands it to ``with: {items: ...}`` before
  validating, as orquesta does; the YAML keeps the shorthand. A schema error on a key the YAML doesn't
  spell out is marked on its nearest parent instead of throwing. (Also in upstream st2web.)
* ESLint no longer lints Playwright's ``test-results/`` and ``playwright-report/``.
* The workflow designer now sets the page title like the other pages, ``<pack.action> - Workflow
  Designer`` (``New workflow`` before the first save), prefixed with ``*`` while there are unsaved
  changes. It never set one, so the tab kept the previous page's title (e.g. ``core.ask - History``).
* Opening a workflow saved without the designer's ``# [x, y]`` task positions (most hand-written
  workflows) no longer marks it as changed. The canvas placing those tasks counted as an edit, so
  Run was disabled ("Cannot run with unsaved changes"), autosave would rewrite the file, and the first
  Undo only un-placed the tasks. Placement now leaves the changed flag and the undo history alone.
  (Also in upstream st2web.)
* Rearranging or dragging tasks in the workflow designer is now a layout change, separate from an
  edit: Save glows and saves the new positions (and autosave saves them), but Run stays enabled and
  the title gets no ``*``, since positions are only ``# [x, y]`` comments and don't change what runs.
  Any other change still blocks Run until it is saved. Autosave no longer saves a workflow just
  because it was opened.
* The login form is drawn as a box on a light grey page, with the Documentation and Support links
  inside it rather than pinned to the bottom of the window. A typo (``style.from``) had kept the
  form's own styles from ever applying.
